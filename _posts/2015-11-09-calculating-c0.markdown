If you read my original post on tuning frequencies, you will see this line in my code:

# based off an instrument tuned to A4 == 440 Hz
C0 = 16.35

I originally set the frequency of the lowest octave C to 16.35 based on a chart online. Recently, I decided to make sure this constant is was precise as possible. So, I decided to calculate it my self. Based on A4 having a frequency of 440 Hz, I created the following equation:

From this, I used Wolfram Alpha to calculate C0.
